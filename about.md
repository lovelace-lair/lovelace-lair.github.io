The Lovelace Lair is a vibrant community of young researchers in Computer Science at Durham University.

Our research interests includes:

  * Computer Vison
  * Deep Learning
  * ...

[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) is a historical figure in computer science. She wrote programs for Babbageâ€™s machine.
We have thus named our lab to honour and commemorate her.
