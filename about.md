The Lovelace Lair is a vibrant community of young researchers in Computer Science at Durham University.

Our research interests include:

  * Deep Learning
  * Computer Vison
  * Image Processing
  * Computer Graphics

We like:

  * Freshly ground arabica coffee prepared using the Aeropress
  * Chatting casually instead of doing actual research
  * Linux! (Majority of our members)
  * Giving and listening to seminars from members within our group

[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) is a historical figure in computer science. She wrote programs for Babbageâ€™s machine.
We have thus named our lab to honour and commemorate her.
